## 🎯 Introduction
Project Defiance is a total overhaul of the Company of Heroes 2 ruleset. It keeps the core gameplay recognizable for veterans while refining mechanics and introducing new options that make every match feel fresh. The transition from vanilla CoH2 to Defiance is smooth, so you can dive in without relearning the entire game, but engaging enough to keep you hooked.

Defiance reimagines balance, abilities, and gameplay flow while respecting the vanilla feel. Weapon damage, cover interactions, and explosive effects have been streamlined to reduce frustrating randomness and improve consistency. The result is a mechanically polished, accessible experience that emphasizes fun and battlefield flow over strict competitive balance.
